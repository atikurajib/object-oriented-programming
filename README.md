# Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS)** repository! This project contains conceptual problem-solving examples and implementations that demonstrate the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Whether you're a beginner learning OOP or an experienced developer looking to reinforce key concepts, this repository has you covered.

The primary goal of this repository is to:
- Provide clear, concise examples that illustrate core OOP concepts.
- Help you understand and apply OOP principles to real-world problems.
- Serve as a reference for OOP best practices and patterns.

## About

This repository includes problem-solving examples and exercises focused on the following Object-Oriented Programming principles:

- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding the basic building blocks of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrating how subclasses can inherit from superclasses.
- **Polymorphism**: Exploring method overriding and interfaces to achieve flexibility.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary components.
- **Abstraction**: Using abstract classes and interfaces to define essential functionality while hiding implementation details.

Each problem comes with a solution that clearly explains the application of OOP concepts in real-world scenarios.

## OOP Concepts Covered

The repository covers various key OOP concepts, including:

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - Basic concepts of defining and using classes and objects in OOP.
  
2. **Inheritance**  
   - How classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   - The ability to use a method in multiple ways, like method overriding and interfaces.

4. **Encapsulation**  
   - Protecting an object's internal state and restricting direct access to its fields.

5. **Abstraction**  
   - Using abstract classes and interfaces to hide complex details and focus on high-level functionality.

## Language

The problem-solving examples are implemented in **Java & Python** programming language.
